# Key Phrase extraction
Keyphrase extraction is a language problem represented as: There is a document D in which there are 1-n key phrases which can be used to understand what the document is about, find other relevant documents, and improve many downstream NLP problems.
In OpenKP we have formalized this problem to focus on the general web domain. The corpus consists of websites which were human annotated for their most relevant key phrases. Its worth noting that during the expert annotation, judges only copied the relevant text from the document and thus there is no language generation required.
